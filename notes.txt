!!! what is done will be written beside it "(done)"

- email added for the opt authentication 
- adding likes
- adding first and last name to the sign up form 
- adding unit testing 
- when sign in as admin in admin panel it also signed in in the main project
  so the only found solution is to make another app called admin and implement admin functionalities 
- add middleware for delaying message delete 
- manage messages in the base.html --> (done)
- bug if i sign in in the main app but an admin sign in the admin panel the main app will be signed in with the admin 
  temp solve is to prevent admin from visiting the main app for now !
- A solution is very simple implement another class called users that inherits from user 
  and when check authentication 
- empty comment 


- a writer should have a Company
- user without company is a signed user
- company is a model
